An algorithm that finds all solutions to the 4=10 game.

# Game rules
4 digits are given (can be from 0 to 9). The goal is to make an expression that equals 10 by using 4 mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) and one set of brackets (optional).
The operators can only be places between the digits. All digits must have exactly one operator between them, for a total of 3 operators.
